**Financial Analysis Project**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for DB Bank to better identify customers who are likely to accept personal loan offers. By analyzing customer demographic data and their relationship with the bank, the model will help in devising targeted marketing campaigns to improve the success rate of loan acceptance, thereby optimizing marketing budgets.

- Utilized SQL, Python (Logistic Regression), and Power BI to enhance personal loan conversions and ROI by 15%, implementing predictive models and targeted marketing strategies.
- Leveraged machine learning and data visualization to optimize financial campaigns, providing DB Bank with actionable insights for targeted customer engagement and improved credit access.

**Data Description**
The dataset bank.csv includes data on 5000 customers. The variables in the dataset are:

Age: Customer's age
Experience: Years of professional experience
Income: Annual income of the customer
ZIP Code: Residential ZIP Code
Family: Family size of the customer
CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month
Education: Education level (1: Undergrad, 2: Graduate, 3: Advanced/Professional)
Mortgage: Value of the mortgage if any
Personal Loan: Whether the customer accepted the personal loan (1: Yes, 0: No)
Securities Account: Whether the customer has a securities account with the bank (1: Yes, 0: No)
CD Account: Whether the customer has a certificate of deposit account with the bank (1: Yes, 0: No)
Online: Whether the customer uses internet banking facilities (1: Yes, 0: No)
CreditCard: Whether the customer uses a credit card issued by the bank (1: Yes, 0: No)

**Project Goals**
1.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect outliers.
2.) Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle missing values.
3.) Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
4.) Model Building: Train various machine learning models to predict personal loan acceptance.
5.) Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and select the best model.
6.) Deployment: Create a pipeline for the selected model for future predictions and decision-making.
